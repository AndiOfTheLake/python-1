## As a calculator

# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*(1.1 ** 7))

## variables and types
# Create a variable savings
savings=100

# Print out savings
print(savings)

# growth multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1

result = savings * growth_multiplier ** 7
print(result)

# Create a variable desc
desc = "compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)

# exercise

"I can add integers, like " + str(5) + " to strings."

"I said " + ("Hey " * 2) + "Hey!"

"The correct answer to this multiple choice exercise is answer number " + str(2)

True + False

## Python lists
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50

# Create list areas
areas = [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)

# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway", hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]

# Print areas
print(areas)

# possible ways to build lists
[1, 3, 4, 2] 
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 7]] 
[1 + 2, "a" * 5, 3]

## Subsetting list
# 0 indexing
# list slicing 
# [start(inclusive):end(exclusive)]

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[1])

# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[-1])

# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[5])

# Sum of kitchen and bedroom area: eat_sleep_area
eat_sleep_area = areas[3] + areas[7]

# Print the variable eat_sleep_area
print(eat_sleep_area)

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Use slicing to create downstairs
downstairs = areas[:6]

# Use slicing to create upstairs
upstairs = areas[6:10]

# Print out downstairs and upstairs
print(upstairs)
print(downstairs)

# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Alternative slicing to create downstairs
